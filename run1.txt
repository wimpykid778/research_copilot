### Mini-Survey on User-Centric AI Design and Onboarding

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various domains necessitates a user-centric approach to design and onboarding, particularly for non-technical users. This survey synthesizes insights from recent studies, highlighting the importance of user-centric AI design, explainability, human-AI collaboration, and the value of weak AI, while identifying key research gaps.

#### User-Centric AI Design and Onboarding

A recurring theme across the literature is the emphasis on designing AI systems with the user in mind, especially for non-technical stakeholders. Effective onboarding processes are crucial for building understanding and trust in AI systems. For instance, in the context of stroke rehabilitation, health professionals and students expressed the need for onboarding that includes benchmark information, practical benefits, and interaction trials to better contextualize AI performance [Paper 1]. This aligns with the broader call for transitioning from explainable AI (XAI) to interactive AI, which provides users with greater agency and engagement, allowing them to adapt and co-design AI systems [Paper 2].

#### Explainability and Comprehensibility

Explainability is a critical component of user-centric AI, with a consensus that explanations must be comprehensible to non-technical users. Tailoring explanations to the audience's expertise level is essential for facilitating decision-making and understanding. Visual aids, such as heatmaps, have been shown to improve task performance by helping users validate AI predictions against their domain knowledge [Paper 4]. However, there is a significant gap between what AI experts consider an "explanation" and what is understandable to non-experts, highlighting the need for XAI methods tailored for non-technical audiences [Paper 3].

#### Human-AI Collaboration

Effective human-AI collaboration is enhanced by systems that allow users to interact with and understand AI decisions. Providing contextual information and practical benefits during onboarding, as well as enabling users to contest and adapt AI outputs, are crucial for fostering collaboration. AI-based games offer a novel approach to studying user interactions and mental models, providing insights into how users comprehend AI systems over time [Paper 6]. This approach can advance the understanding of human-centered XAI by offering a deeper understanding of user comprehension.

#### Value of Weak AI

While "weak AI" may not evolve into "strong AI," its current capabilities in specific tasks hold significant value. The focus should be on leveraging these capabilities to enhance human decision-making and task performance. Despite criticisms of AI being primarily about "curve fitting" and lacking causal reasoning, weak AI has achieved significant breakthroughs in specific tasks like image classification and speech recognition [Paper 5].

#### Key Research Gaps

1. **Generalizability of Findings:** Many studies are context-specific, limiting the generalizability of findings across different domains and user groups. More research is needed to validate these insights in diverse settings [Paper 1, Paper 4].

2. **Empirical Validation of User-Centric Approaches:** While there is a strong theoretical foundation for user-centric AI design, there is a lack of empirical data supporting the practical application of these approaches in real-world systems. Future research should focus on implementing and testing these methods in various industries [Paper 2].

3. **Understanding and Evolving Mental Models:** The evolution of users' mental models during interactions with AI is not well understood. More research is needed to explore how these models develop over time and how they can be effectively captured and analyzed [Paper 6].

4. **Divergent Definitions of Explainability:** There is a need to address the divergent definitions of "explanation" and "explainability" within the XAI community. Establishing a common framework or guidelines could help standardize how explanations are developed and evaluated [Paper 3].

5. **Scalability of Interactive AI:** While interactive AI offers promising benefits, its scalability and integration into existing systems remain challenges. Research should explore how these systems can be effectively scaled and maintained in various operational environments [Paper 2].

### Conclusion

The synthesis of recent studies underscores the importance of user-centric AI design and onboarding, explainability, and human-AI collaboration. While weak AI holds significant value in its current form, addressing the identified research gaps is crucial for advancing the field. Future research should focus on validating user-centric approaches across diverse settings, understanding the evolution of mental models, and establishing standardized frameworks for explainability.
